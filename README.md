# Project 3: Spots
 

**Intro**
  
  This is the the third project from TriplTen. We were given the task to create a responsive website using Figma. Not only was brining out Figma diffrent fron the other projects,but also the fact that the design had to respond to diffrent screen sizes while maintaing it appearence in all elemmts was a real challenge.

## Plan on improving the project

Working on the spots project I saw many great rooms for oppurtunities. I hope that in the future I can be able to give an option to be able to comment under the images of the users choice. I would also like to give a section to the top of the header to be able to potentiallty share specific items users may find interesting.
